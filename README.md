# R2D2-Droid
Arduino project to make an R2D2 droid with my son. I am letting him direct the project as we work through requirements and POC iterations. 


## Project Requirements
- on/off switch
- Head turns
- Whistles
- Drive/Navigation by self
- Changing color light in head
- Looks like R2D2 (compenent packaging/function)

### Drive/Navigation
Using this [amazon arduino avoidance bot kit](https://amzn.to/3b5XqVA) as the core components for the drive mechanism as well as the oscillator for the head movement. the ultra sonic distiance sensor will be in the head of the droid. 

### Appearance/likeness to R2D2
When an object is dectected, an "angry" noise will be immitted. When the path is clear, an assorment of "happy" chirps will be played. The led in the head should also change color. 

### Whistles
Following [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/R2D2-Sound-Generator/) and using [these amazon speakers](https://amzn.to/38W7TzV) to make the iconic R2D2 sounds.
